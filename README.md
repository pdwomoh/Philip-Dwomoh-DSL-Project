# Identifying Food Desert Neighbourhoods in the Niagara Region

### Introduction
For this project, I will explore neighbourhood data using ArcGIS Insights to identify food desert neighbourhoods in Niagara Region. Data for the purpose of this project were gathered from Niagara Open Data and Niagara Poverty Initiative websites. Variables that will be examined to identify food deserts are distance to supermarkets and number of supermarkets. I will also analyze the data to detect spatial patterns. Finally, I will share my work on ArcGIS online and create new shapefiles from my results.

### Project Procedures

1 . Download the Niagara Food Deserts compressed folder from the GitHub link below:
https://github.com/pdwomoh/Philip-Dwomoh-DSL-Project

2 . Locate the downloaded file on your computer. Right-click the file and extract it to a location where you can easily find it, such as your Documents folder.

3 . Sign in to your Insights Online account:https://insights.arcgis.com/#/

>**Note**: If this is your first time using Insights, the **Welcome to Insights** window appears with a list of things you can do with Insights.


4 . If necessary, in the **Welcome to Insights** window, click **Skip**.

5 . Click the **Workbooks** tab.

6 . Click **New workbook**.

>The datasets are added to a new card in your workbook. 
>You use cards and pages to organize information in a workbook.
>Each page can contain multiple cards, and each card can contain a map, chart, or table.

![picture of enable location][logo5]

           
16 . In the **Enable Location** window, for **Location type**, choose *Geography*. For **Location Fields** choose *Multiple*, and for the **Multiple Fields** choose *NHB_NAME and MUN*. For **Matching Geography Level**, choose *Niagara Neighbourhood Boundaries*.

![picture of location type in enable location][logo6]

 
17 . Click **Run**.

18 . When the **Enable Location tool** finish loading, a new locations attribute named **Niagara Neighbourhood Boundaries** is added to **Food Deserts Data**.

![picture of new location in the data pane][logo7]

 
 
>Note: I chose geography as the location type because the food Deserts Data did not have any coordinate or address attribute.
>Hence making it possible to correspond the food deserts data’s locations to that of the zipped Niagara Neighbourhood boundaries  shapefile. 


19 . Rename the following fields in the food deserts data in the data pane:

From |	To 
--- | ---
NBH_NAME |	Niagara Neighbourhoods
MUN |	Municipality
No_sup |	Number of Supermarkets
No. supermarket within 5km |	Number of Supermarket within 5 km


After completing the renaming, click on the **Food Deserts Data** to close the drop-down attribute.


20 . In the data pane, Drag **Food Deserts Data** to your page and onto the **Chart** drop zone. And finally drag it to the **Bar Chart** zone.

### Conclusion

This project explored the potential of ArcGIS Insight in identifying Niagara's food desert Neighbourhoods.The findings revealed that neighbourhoods deemed as food deserts within 5 km were Caistor, Wainfleet, Gainsborough, Bethel/Gasline/Sherkston and Stevensville. Results from the project were also shared on ArcGIS online. Finally, new shapefiles were created from the project results.
